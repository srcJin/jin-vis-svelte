  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Boston is a city we are most familiar with that has accessible land value
    and geographical data. Because of the rich historical context of the city,
    it consists of distinct urban form typologies within a certain range so that
    we can limit the influence from other factors. In this project, we want to
    reveal the relationship between land prices and different kinds of urban
    form, to find how urban form affects land price based on facts, and form a
    guideline for urban designers, real estate developers, policymakers, and
    planners to make decisions for more equitable cities.

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    The preliminary findings of this topic do reveal some relationship between
    urban form and land value. But they are not conclusive. Land value can be
    affected by so many factors and is changing throughout the time, especially
    in the internet era that the popularity of one place can be changed within
    hours. So this topic could be further explored by making it more responsive
    and consider more parameters, finding the major impact factor and revealing
    the value change throughout time.
