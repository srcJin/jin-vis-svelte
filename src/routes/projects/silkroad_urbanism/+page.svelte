  <h1>Silkroad Urbanism</h1>
  <h3>The Making of Cities Course Research</h3>
  <h4>Collaborator: Yufei Chen, Advisor: Roi Salgueiro Barrio</h4>

  <p>
    Since the Roman Period, the Silk Road has always been a corridor that serves
    as an infrastructure contributing to the territorial organization,
    interconnecting the cities, and gaining connectivity. The transfer and
    interaction of cultures led to the formation of numerous architectural
    elements that sprung up along this corridor. Today, a series of modern
    urbanization is underway with the rapid implementation of the Belt and Road
    Initiative, the world's largest infrastructure project in decades.
    Positioning ourselves as the mediators between past, present, and future, we
    focus on how Asian civilizations have gained influence in the mutually
    restrictive Indo-European cultural circles through commodity economies,
    material, and economic exchanges. Through architectural elements, urban
    texture, and citizens' behavior, we can reveal the hidden connection that
    reflects the Silk Road as a driving force and a negotiation tool for
    international geopolitical cooperation.

  <h4>Istanbul Major Developments under Belt and Road Initiative</h4>
  <p>
    The map reinforces the existence of the Southern China-Europe Railway that
    went across Istanbul city. With the establishment of this railway route, it
    becomes possible to travel from Xi'an to Turkey within 12 days -- one-half
    to one-fourth compared with sea transportation. The railway connection
    enabled commodity trade to spread across Eurasia at unimaginable speed and
    thus reshape the urbanization process in the long run

  <h4>World City Connected by the Aerial Silk Road</h4>
  <p>
    The "Air Silk Road" can overcome the infrastructure problems associated with
    land transportation and the geographical limitations of maritime transport.
    Therefore it becomes a vital supplement for high-value and time-sensitive
    goods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over 371 cities is connected by Istanbul airport, and 96 of them provide
    cargo accessibilities.[2] Within 12 hours of flight, passengers can travel
    to most parts of the world - even less with the future ultrasonic planes.
    Airports provide a modern urban interface, and airplanes are the high-speed
    data lines between cities. Working together, airports in all major cities
    weave an intersecting network, which also acts as the solid infrastructure
    for the so-called 'global cities.' We want to use this map to show how much
    of a role the establishment of an airport can play in the growth of the
    global cities.
